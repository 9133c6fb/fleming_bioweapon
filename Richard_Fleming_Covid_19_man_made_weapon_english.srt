1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,640
Are you prepared to testify under oath here today that
covid-19 is a bioweapon? Yes, I am.

2
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,370
Bringing truth, delighted, unbiased and nonpartisan
factually founded reporting worldwide.

3
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:34,298
Dr. Fleming, we've asked you to come testify about whether
Covid-19 and related vaccines are a deliberate bioweapon
attack on the United States.

4
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:38,334
Adam Court Reporter can you please identify yourself for
the record? My name is Karen Usher.

5
00:00:38,382 --> 00:00:41,198
Texas. CSR number 5536.
Thank you.

6
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:49,838
Can you please swear in the witness? Dr.
Fleming, will you raise your right hand? Do you swear the
testimony you give today will be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth will help you God? I do.

7
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:55,600
Dr. Fleming, do you consent to this testimony being used in
any appropriate proceeding? Yes, I do.

8
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,538
First, I'd like to cover some of your qualifications.

9
00:01:03,574 --> 00:01:07,794
You have an impressive 90 page resume.
I'm not going to go through that.

10
00:01:07,832 --> 00:01:10,974
But very briefly, are you a medical doctor? Yes, I am.

11
00:01:11,012 --> 00:01:13,690
So therefore you have an MD degree, as it's known.

12
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,538
I do, yes.

13
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:18,658
And what is your area of specialty? Nuclear cardiology.

14
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:20,398
Cardiology and internal medicine.

15
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:25,218
And do you also belong to professional medical
associations? Yes, I do.

16
00:01:25,304 --> 00:01:28,854
Are you a fellow of the American College of Physicians? Yes.

17
00:01:28,952 --> 00:01:32,754
And are you a fellow of the American Society of Internal
Medicine? Yes.

18
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:35,934
And you also hold a PhD.
Yes, I do.

19
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:40,798
And in what field is this? Physics. And you also have a law degree,
otherwise known as a JD.

20
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:41,660
I do.

21
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,270
And are you an inventor in the medical field? Yes.

22
00:01:45,380 --> 00:02:00,058
And very briefly, can you explain the type of medical
inventions that you've invented? The ability to image the
body and determine what types of disease processes are
going on by looking at metabolism and blood flow.

23
00:02:00,214 --> 00:02:03,126
Do you hold patents for your inventions? Yes, I do.

24
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:07,002
Is it fair to say you're familiar with the world of medical
patents? Yes.

25
00:02:07,076 --> 00:02:10,746
You have the ability to read and interpret medical patents?
Yes, I do.

26
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:13,758
And are you also an author of professional papers? Yes, sir.

27
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:16,638
And approximately how many? Somewhere between 4 and 500.

28
00:02:16,664 --> 00:02:24,694
And do you also serve on the editorial board of
professional journals? On editorial boards and review
boards for the journals.

29
00:02:24,802 --> 00:02:39,258
And briefly, what does a reviewer in a professional journal
do? The obligation is when somebody submits a paper for
publication, for reviewers to take a look at that material,
to determine if it's scientifically valid, to determine if

30
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:49,770
it makes a difference in the field, and to make
recommendations back to the editorial board about whether
the papers should be accepted or revised or rejected for
publication.

31
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,570
Are you prepared to testify under oath here today that
Covid-19 is a bioweapon? Yes, I am.

32
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,280
You wrote a book posing the question, Is COVID-19 a
bioweapon? Correct? Correct.

33
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:26,990
The function of the book was to provide information that
the general public could look at and also to provide
evidence for the legal system and the medical system to
understand the gain of function research that has been
carried out over a couple of decades.

34
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,446
To show where the money came from.

35
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:34,814
To show what papers were published showing what types of
gain of function research occurred.

36
00:03:34,862 --> 00:03:43,426
And to show the patents to clearly lay out two decades
worth of work that's been conducted, 
funded primarily by the United States.

37
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,506
Although other countries have been involved.

38
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:52,690
And to show how there's no evidence that SARS-CoV2
The virus that causes Covid-19.

39
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,418
No evidence to show that it's naturally occurring.
No animal model for it.

40
00:03:57,444 --> 00:04:02,760
And to show the type of research that's been done with
coronaviruses funded by the US.

41
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:15,818
Supported by NIAID NIH Department of Defense money that
went to Peter Daszak at Eco Health, to  Ralph Baric at the
University of North Carolina, to Shi Zhengli at the Wuhan Institute of virology,

42
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:20,302
and there are several other
universities around the country, including in the state of Texas

43
00:04:20,316 --> 00:04:28,294
Did you also look at the genetic code of the SARS-CoV2
virus and especially the spike protein? We did,

44
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:37,078
as well as Professor Luke Montaignier, who is the gentleman who
discovered the HIV virus, and several other individuals
that we note in the book.

45
00:04:37,164 --> 00:04:42,610
And based on that review of the genetic code that informs
your conclusion that this is a bio weapon, right.

46
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:55,226
So the Biological Weapons Convention Treaty states that any
adjustment or modification of a biological agent like this
virus that doesn't provide a benefit for mankind is a
biological weapon.

47
00:04:55,298 --> 00:05:03,362
These particular changes in this virus.
Including the PRRA insert, which are amino acids that were inserted.

48
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:14,954
That are very critical for the pure and cleavage site for
this virus to infect. The insertion sites that were made
with HIV and Simian or ape-like HIV equivalent viruses.

49
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:19,550
The prion like domain at the top of the spike protein.

50
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,874
As well as the HIV Glycoprotein 120 insert that Shi Zhengli
put in early on.

51
00:05:24,912 --> 00:05:30,626
That's critical for the attachment of this virus to cells.
All of which are not naturally occurring.

52
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:41,978
So to be clear, the SARS-CoV2 virus, otherwise known as
Covid-19, and especially its spiked protein, is not
something that's simply involved on its own in nature.

53
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:46,370
We've looked at all the different coronaviruses that exist
on the planet.

54
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,382
None of them have the PRRA insert, none of them have this
tremendous amount of HIV insert.

55
00:05:52,526 --> 00:06:01,994
None of them have a regional binding domain that is a prion-like
binding domain, which means that where it attaches to
the cells, it's a prion-like domain.

56
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:08,414
And prions are things that are abnormal proteins that cause
other proteins to become abnormally folded.

57
00:06:08,522 --> 00:06:19,378
So to be clear, genetic changes were made to the spike
protein in a lab to create what is known as the COVID-19.
Correct? That's what all the data shows.

58
00:06:19,524 --> 00:06:26,590
Your book references research in 2010 by Shi Zhang Li, who
is often called the Bat Lady.

59
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:34,522
Was that research designed to determine how to increase the spike protein binding capacity to the human S2 receptor.

60
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:41,102
So that was her goal of that research, was to
increase the ability of the virus to infect human cells.

61
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:55,260
Now, interestingly, I think in this published research,
they discovered that the naturally occurring spike protein
from horseshoe bats was unable to bind to the human S2
receptors. Right? That's exactly right.

62
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:07,442
So as of 2010, scientists, including Shi Zhengli and Wuhan
China, knew that naturally occurring horseshoe back
coronavirus spike proteins could not infect humans.

63
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:08,400
That's right.

64
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:18,754
Based on your testimony, it sounds like you discovered at
least two man made inserts into the SARS-CoV2 spike
protein genetic code that prove it was produced in a lab.

65
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:32,726
Right. The research papers that Shi Zhengli and Baric
and others published, they were very clear and somewhat
proud of the fact that they've been able to modify the
virus and to insert changes into it that made it more
effective and potentially more dangerous.

66
00:07:32,798 --> 00:07:38,546
There's some laboratory mechanism where they're able to
take genetic code from elsewhere and put it into a virus.

67
00:07:38,678 --> 00:07:43,102
Right. So you can actually build anything if you know what
the structures are.

68
00:07:43,116 --> 00:07:46,354
It's like building a car if you know what the parts are,
you simply put it together.

69
00:07:46,452 --> 00:07:54,002
Many of the research studies that we have pointed out, they
took bits and pieces of one virus, combined it with bits
and pieces of another virus.

70
00:07:54,086 --> 00:08:00,358
If you go and look at those papers, you'll also find that
they were very specific by inserting five nucleotide base
pairs in there.

71
00:08:00,384 --> 00:08:06,190
So they simply switched the base pairs, and that will result in a different amino acid being added in a different protein.

72
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:17,054
Let's talk about the first insert that you found
in the SARS-CoV2 virus that led you to conclude that it
was a man made bioweapon.

73
00:08:17,222 --> 00:08:22,334
The first one I think you referred to as the furin cleavage
PRRA insert.

74
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:23,506
Correct? That's correct.

75
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:33,110
Can you explain briefly what that is? Okay, so that's four
amino acids that were put in when this virus attaches.

76
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:40,980
And I know this is long and complicated because a lot of
people have heard of S2, which is one of the
receptors, but it's a multi step process.

77
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:54,022
The HIV Glycoprotein 120 insert, which was the second one
we talked about, is required to attach to what's called a
cyanic acid receptor raft that stabilizes it and puts it in position.

78
00:08:54,036 --> 00:09:08,738
The virus then comes into contact with the H2
receptor that then undergoes a change with something called
a TMPRSS-2 receptor, which is critical to understanding

79
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:12,334
because that begins the process of bringing that virus into
the cell.

80
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:21,038
It then has to undergo furin cleavage at the Furin cleavage
site. And that's the PRRA, which makes it particularly
infective for human cells.

81
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:27,070
And then it comes across also something known as neuropilin-1 receptor, which is found in the brain.

82
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:33,946
How did you discover that this PRRA cleavage insert had
been made to SARS-CoV2.

83
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:38,786
All you have to do is the nucleotide base sequencing, which
is how we know all the variants occur.

84
00:09:38,918 --> 00:09:42,250
And when you do that, you find this PRRA insert.

85
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:50,186
Now, this genetic code for the furin cleavage insert, the
PRRA, is that found in any other coronavirus in nature?

86
00:09:50,378 --> 00:09:55,442
None. It's not found in any other coronavirus that exists
in the wild.

87
00:09:55,526 --> 00:09:59,246
Right. There's absolutely no other coronavirus that has
this PRRA insert.

88
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:01,334
That's twelve nucleotide bases.

89
00:10:01,382 --> 00:10:15,502
Not a single base like sickle cell, but twelve specific
nucleotide bases to provide for four amino acids that very
specifically is connected with the furin cleavage site
which the US government owns the patent on.

90
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:24,650
So the fact that this insert and this genetic sequence for
this insert is not found in any other coronavirus in
nature, what does that tell you?

91
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:37,318
Well, since mutations occur one nucleotide base at a time, you would have to come
up with some phenomenal explanation for why twelve
nucleotide bases suddenly inserted themselves into a virus
that none of it the other viruses in that category have.

92
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:48,262
The original premise that was put forward and actually
published in The Lancet was that this was a naturally
occurring virus with an animal host that got transmitted to people.

93
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:52,426
But yet there's not been a single animal model
found with this.

94
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:56,930
Neither has there been a single coronavirus that has this
PRRA insert.

95
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:02,306
You mentioned the second insert, an HIV Glycoprotein.

96
00:11:02,438 --> 00:11:10,414
Right. So are you saying that sections of the genetic code
for HIV were inserted into the SARS-CoV2 virus? Yes.

97
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:20,530
Shi Zhengli published this early on, many years ago, where
she was very proud of the fact that she did this.
She used an HIV pseudovirus to do it.

98
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,690
And we also know that HIV Glycoprotein 120 is a prion.

99
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:31,682
So this is the HIV that became famous in the 1980s and 1990s.
That HIV?

100
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:37,702
Right. And somebody took pieces of the genetic code of HIV
and put it into SARS-CoV2.

101
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:40,918
That's what Shi Zhengli admitted to in publications that
she had.

102
00:11:40,944 --> 00:11:50,350
Yes. Were you able to discover why that was done? According
to papers that she published, it was to increase the
infectivity to see if she could make it more effective.

103
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:57,242
But it's even clearer that what she was going for was the
development of a prion disease.

104
00:11:57,326 --> 00:12:06,878
Because where everybody is kind of coming up to speed with
a virus and how challenging it can be to deal with, what's
even more challenging to deal with are prions.

105
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:16,718
Because prion diseases are relatively new in our
understanding, for treatment, and they cause permanent
damage unless they can be reversed.

106
00:12:16,814 --> 00:12:29,302
And so the development of a prion, putting HIV Glycoprotein
120 in there, attaching to the salic acid receptor,
there's nothing about that  is advantageous for people.

107
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:38,918
And the ability to produce prion diseases is quite a
weapon. And how lethal are prion diseases? People die from
prion diseases.

108
00:12:39,014 --> 00:12:54,010
This process of inserting these amino acids to increase the
infectivity is that gain of function, right. So gain of
function is anything that you do that changes a naturally
occurring biological agent like this virus.

109
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:59,158
The premise of gain of function really has a good premise
behind it.

110
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:13,390
The original idea being that if you could stay a step ahead
of a potential infectious agent, say a coronavirus, if you
could say just a step ahead, you could do a good job of
providing treatments for people and knowing when and where
it was going to spread.

111
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,242
This isn't a step ahead.
This isn't a single nucleotide base.

112
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:23,518
This is a spike protein that has an HIV Glycoprotein 120
insert into it.

113
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:30,422
This is a spike protein that has four amino acids to make a
pure and cleavage site the PRRA insert.

114
00:13:30,566 --> 00:13:36,674
This is a spike protein that has multiple others, According to Luke Montagnier, HIV and SIV inserts.

115
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:40,330
This is not something that evolutionarily evolved.

116
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:45,346
The evolution of something with this many changes would
take hundreds or thousands of years.

117
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:53,414
This is not staying a step ahead of it and making this
provided no advantage for human beings, which makes it a
Biological Weapons Convention treaty violation.

118
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:57,000
This is playing up.

119
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:10,790
To your knowledge, has anyone been able to disprove or
refute the fact that there are artificial man made
insertions into the SARS-CoV2 virus? Actually, there's
been no dispute of that except for the statement that it's
naturally occurring.

120
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:17,086
And then when you say, well, where's the scientific
evidence that it's naturally occurring? There's no follow
up to that.

121
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:24,482
So that for people that are claiming that this is a
scientific discussion, I would encourage them to stay with
the fact that this is a scientific discussion.

122
00:14:24,626 --> 00:14:29,222
There's no science to show that any other coronavirus on
the planet has these inserts.

123
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:35,222
There's no science to show that there's a natural reservoir
and animal for this virus to occur.

124
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:44,774
In fact, the science points to the fact with over 99%
probability, which is what we're dealing with, until
somebody comes up and confesses that this is not naturally occuring.

125
00:14:44,822 --> 00:14:58,826
In your mind, is there any doubt that without
this gain of function manipulation of the SARS-CoV2
spike protein, there would have been no pandemic
we wouldn't have had this, had this virus not been released.

126
00:14:59,018 --> 00:15:08,026
Have any of these folks, Daszak, Baric, Shi Zhengli, Fauci
explained what that beneficial alleged effect is?

127
00:15:08,028 --> 00:15:14,878
Well, up until now, it seems like most of their conversation has
been we didn't do anything like that, even though the data
is now showing it.

128
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:26,014
But as we've learned over the last couple of months, the
National Institutes of Health and National Institutes of
Allergies and Infectious Disease have now admitted that
they needed to.

129
00:15:26,112 --> 00:15:31,894
But it's nice for them to admit that a gain of functional
research was funded for by the US.

130
00:15:32,052 --> 00:15:39,060
And that Fauci statements that they weren't involved in
gain of function research was not correct.

131
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:56,210
Dr. Faucie testified under oath to Congress, under
questioning by Senator Rand Paul that the NIH and NIAID had
not funded gain a function research.

132
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:03,330
Was that statement truthful? Well, as we've shown and as
we've talked about, that was a lie.

133
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,906
And that lie can be proven by publicly available documents.

134
00:16:07,038 --> 00:16:16,840
Dr. Fauci denied under oath that they provided any gain of
functional research just despite the fact that we have a
long track record of gain of function research.

135
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:31,660
In fact, that gain of function research even occurred
during the time that it would shut down during the Clinton
administration due to concern by scientists like myself
that saw problems with infections getting out from gain of
function research.

136
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:43,086
That money still got funneled around primarily through
Peter Dezak, whom it got funneled out to Baric and Shi Zhengli and other sources.

137
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:53,870
And they're denying that they're connected with each other
just completely goes in the face their
publications, published papers where both of their names,
Baris and Shi Zhengli around there.

138
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:01,674
You can find the publications that show NIH funding.
This was not a well hidden secret.

139
00:17:01,782 --> 00:17:08,414
NIH has now come out since with a statement admitting that
they have provided gain of function research.

140
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:18,040
And part of this gain of function was designed to make that
coronavirus spike proteins infectious to humans when they
were not before.

141
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:35,106
It's very clear from the research grants that were paid for by the United States from the published papers
that Shi Zheng Li and the others have published by the pattens have been published that they
specifically set out to increase and
made possible the ability of these viruses to infect.

142
00:17:35,238 --> 00:17:42,554
Particularly with the HKU-4 and the HIV pseudovirus
glycoprotein -120 inserts that Shi Zhengli and the others were involved with.

143
00:17:42,652 --> 00:17:48,494
That they intentionally sought to make this more infectious
and, in fact, Accomplished it.

144
00:17:48,592 --> 00:17:51,774
And who were the main players in these genetic engineering experiments?

145
00:17:51,822 --> 00:18:03,738
Well, the primary ones that we know of are
Peter Desak at Eco Health, Ralph Baric at the University
of North Carolina, and Shi Zhengli at the Wuan Institute
of Virology.

146
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,354
But we know that there's been other individuals involved.

147
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:11,738
We know that other universities, including here in Texas
how are you able to uncover this gain of function research and who funded it?

148
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:19,130
There were a lot of very interesting
sources that were coming forth suggesting places to look.

149
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:29,234
But basically what I did is what any researcher does when
they ask a question, which is if you know what question to
ask, you can get a wealth of information if somebody has it
out there.

150
00:18:29,272 --> 00:18:42,186
So I began querying the federal funding sources
specifically looking at Eco Health and gain of function research.
And that allowed me to run down the actual grant numbers.

151
00:18:42,258 --> 00:18:52,922
So what we have in the book, you don't have to
take my word for it, is the actual grant numbers, how much
monies there were, whether it came from the Department of Defense, which, by the way, paid for more than half of this.

152
00:18:52,936 --> 00:18:59,282
Did you discover there were attempts to cover up the
funding of this gain of function research?

153
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:20,510
Yeah, there were a lot of attempts, not very good ones, as far as I'm
concerned, but including the Lancet letter where Dezak and
so many others got together and then published that 'this
was obviously a naturally occurring virus' doing everything
imaginable to skew the scientific medical literature,

154
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:27,378
to get people to not consider the possibility of it being a
gain of function laboriented bioweapons.

155
00:19:27,414 --> 00:19:35,020
And did this research violate any treaties or laws? The
Biological Weapons Convention treaty is very specific.

156
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:48,678
It states that any bacterial agent, in this case a virus
that does not have a benefit for humanity is a violation of
the Biological Weapons Convention Treaty.

157
00:19:48,714 --> 00:19:52,962
And it's important to note that this is a treaty that the
United States has signed and ratified.

158
00:19:53,106 --> 00:19:58,490
Article Six of the US.
Constitution states that treaties are the supreme law of
the land.

159
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,442
The signing and ratification of the Biological Weapons
Convention treaty.

160
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:07,242
The signing and ratification of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights.

161
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:23,166
The United States participating in the Nuremberg Trials of 1947
to establish the Nuremberg Code and how patients would be
treated, the Declaration of Helsinki that the US.
Has committed to for research patients.

162
00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:42,398
The American Medical Association Code of Ethics on Informed
Consent, that 'anybody violating these have already
demonstrated that they not only are interested in providing
informed consent and patient rights, but if they're
violating a treaty, they have violated the US. Constitution.

163
00:20:42,484 --> 00:21:05,790
And anybody who has taken an oath of office,
anybody who has stood there and sworn to uphold and defend
the Constitution of the United States, who then ignores
these treaties,  funds violation of
these treaties, as was done in this instance,

164
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:11,658
who refuses to allow patients to have informed consent, the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

165
00:21:11,694 --> 00:21:14,930
If you've done that, you have violated the US. Constitution.

166
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:20,750
And if you've taken an oath to uphold
defend the Constitution, then you have committed treason.

167
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:30,530
When you reach the conclusion that SARS-CoV2 was a
bioweapon released on the planet, what was your reaction?

168
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,430
Uncomfortable and disappointed.

169
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:45,610
These individuals have presented nothing to suggest that
this type of research was something that they thought was
for the benefit of humanity.

170
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:53,360
And considering the funding sources...

171
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:09,446
If you look at the Emergency Use Authorization documents,
the documents submitted to the FDA, you have to ask
yourself two questions, and the data is right in the EUA documents.

172
00:22:09,446 --> 00:22:13,754
The first question is, how many people get sick?

173
00:22:13,802 --> 00:22:22,394
And that's this number that we talk about, vaccine
efficacy, how many people get sick if they're vaccinated
versus how many people get sick if they weren't vaccinated?

174
00:22:22,502 --> 00:22:25,258
So that's a vaccine efficacy number.

175
00:22:25,404 --> 00:22:29,762
But if you ask the question, Why are people getting
vaccinated? That's not why they're getting vaccinated.

176
00:22:29,786 --> 00:22:35,830
They're getting vaccinated so they don't get sick.
And that's called an absolute risk reduction.

177
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:43,426
And if you go to the EUA documents, for Pfizer Moderna Johnson
and the three that are EUA approved in the US.

178
00:22:43,608 --> 00:23:00,530
And you asked that fundamental question, how many people do
not get sick for pfizer that using their data? There is no
statistically significant reduction in COVID cases for
vaccinated people versus unvaccinated.

179
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:10,930
If you look at Moderna, the same thing, no statistical
reduction in Covid cases for the vaccinated versus the
unvaccinated. Jansson did a little bit more complex.

180
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:20,002
They looked at results at two weeks, 14 days after their
injection, and 28 days or four weeks.

181
00:23:20,136 --> 00:23:29,126
Now, if you look at their data at two weeks after the
injection, there is a statistical reduction in the number
of COVID cases.

182
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:34,150
If you carry that out two more weeks, which they did, that
difference is gone.

183
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:41,702
So if you want to vaccinate people, I guess every two
weeks, go for it.
It doesn't prevent you from getting infected.

184
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:47,302
Statistically it didn't reduce the number of COVID cases or deaths, and
it doesn't prevent you from transmitting it.

185
00:23:47,376 --> 00:23:53,374
And that's what we're seeing right now.
No virus comes in just one flavor, if you will.

186
00:23:53,472 --> 00:24:04,630
Just like if you look around a room, you'll see a whole
bunch of people and they're all variants, but they're all
very much human, right? So SARS-CoV2 didn't just come as
WUHAN-HU1

187
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:10,822
It had the alpha and the beta and the gamma and the lambda
and the delta and all the other variants, all the different changes.

188
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:24,158
And what we've done in the past is we've taken and
made vaccines by taking all of the parts of a virus with
all of the variants and weakening it, and then injecting that into people,

189
00:24:24,194 --> 00:24:33,262
so that if you saw another version of it
or other parts of it, you would have an immune response to it.

190
00:24:33,276 --> 00:24:40,718
What we did with these vaccines is we very specifically
said, let's just look at the spike protein of the original one,

191
00:24:40,754 --> 00:24:50,546
the one called WUHAN-HU1, and let's make that
genetic code and turn the human cells into a manufacturing
plant to make those spiked proteins.

192
00:24:50,678 --> 00:24:57,454
What did that do? But the people who got vaccinated, many of them who did it because they were worried about other people.

193
00:24:57,492 --> 00:25:05,558
So understanding that these people were well
intentioned, they were afraid, they were fearful.

194
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:08,578
They didn't want somebody else to get sick because of them.

195
00:25:08,604 --> 00:25:10,778
They didn't want other family members to become sick.

196
00:25:10,814 --> 00:25:15,662
They didn't want the man or the woman down the street who
had cancer or heart disease to become sick.

197
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:23,938
So as good citizens, they were told, you need to do this
and it will make a difference, but the vaccines don't
prevent you from getting infected or spreading it.

198
00:25:23,964 --> 00:25:34,342
So by using this approach, we injected this mRNA and DNA
into people for just one type of spike protein,

199
00:25:34,356 --> 00:25:47,580
not the rest of the virus, not the nucleic capsid, which turns out
to be what humans make the best immune response to, not the
envelope, not the membrane, and not the other types of
spike protein. One type!

200
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,394
And so what we see is people getting vaccinated with it.

201
00:25:51,492 --> 00:26:01,894
And if you track what's happened, not only in the United
States, but around the world as these vaccines have been
used, fewer and fewer people have gotten infected with the
WUHAN-HU1.

202
00:26:01,992 --> 00:26:07,178
Or if they've gotten infected, they were ready for it, but
they weren't ready for the other variants.

203
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:16,834
The alpha, the beta, the gamma, the delta, the mu, the now
Omicron, as people like to call it, what I call it 21K.

204
00:26:16,872 --> 00:26:19,414
But Omicron is now the term for it.

205
00:26:19,572 --> 00:26:24,746
Those, they didn't have an immune response too, so they
responded to it rapidly.

206
00:26:24,878 --> 00:26:32,578
And then when they spread the virus to other people, they
spread the ones that weren't attacked because the immune
system wasn't ready for it.

207
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:39,842
So we've done a great job of pressure selecting out this
virus to the variants so that we're spreading and shifting it.

208
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:52,042
And now the spike protein of Omicron is so much
different than even delta or alpha or WUHAN-HU1 that the ability
of our immune system to respond to that isn't there.

209
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:59,938
And we're seeing more and more people with this variant
coming down with symptoms and spreading it to other people.

210
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:07,474
When you ask to have the vaccines done a good job of
reducing this, all you have to do is look at the science.
All you have to do is look at the numbers.

211
00:27:07,632 --> 00:27:18,382
Israel vaccinated the vast majority of its country with the
Pfizer and oederna vaccines, and their cases of delta
escalated right off the chart as a result of it.

212
00:27:18,396 --> 00:27:20,414
They simply did pressure selection.

213
00:27:20,462 --> 00:27:29,880
In the United States, we've done the same thing where we're
seeing the Omicron variants and the Delta variants being
pressure selected out by this vaccine program.

214
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:40,238
This has not helped reduce it.
It simply shifted the variants and persisted the problem
and stressed people and made people afraid.

215
00:27:40,394 --> 00:27:52,226
In this case, if you look at the data, the difference
between vaccinated and unvaccinated on an absolute risk
reduction standard was statistically insignificant.

216
00:27:52,298 --> 00:28:05,314
The absolute risk reduction is somewhere between 0.8 and
1.3%. And that was known by the FDA and the drug
manufacturers before these vaccines were rolled out.

217
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:13,210
What bothers me, I watched these FDA meetings for the EUA,
and none of the people on the panel raised the question,

218
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:28,970
what's the absolute risk reduction, which is the goal of
actually vaccinating people? I watched the FDA meetings for
the booster shots, and I don't remember whether it was
Pfizer or Moderna.

219
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:39,062
I want to say it was Moderna, but I won't swear to it.
The head of their vaccine project said that T cell response
was unimportant.

220
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:46,378
Well, T cell response is critical because you have T cells
and B cells, and it just refers to where they come from.

221
00:28:46,404 --> 00:28:53,580
But the T cell response, it's called innate immunity, is
critical. And it's the first thing that happens to people,

222
00:28:54,150 --> 00:29:02,914
the B cells or antibody responses occurs several days
later. But for the antibody response to occur, the T cells
have to be working.

223
00:29:03,072 --> 00:29:14,474
And we know from published data and I provided documents on
this that the Pfizer Moderna vaccines suppress the T cell
response in people that get the vaccine.

224
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:24,086
Not only does the count of those cells go down, but the
chemicals that they produce, interferon which simply
means it interferes with the production of viruses.

225
00:29:24,218 --> 00:29:35,966
And what's called T helper two cells, which are a type of T
cell that's critical to help make the right antibody
response. All of that is suppressed in individuals who get
these vaccines.

226
00:29:36,098 --> 00:29:47,422
Listening to people tell me that they're 'Mr science'. Or Big
Pharma saying that it's 'all about the science' or anybody
else saying it's 'all about the science',

227
00:29:47,436 --> 00:29:52,634
I'm seeing a tremendous lack of actual science integrity and
interrogation of the science.

228
00:29:52,682 --> 00:30:03,142
Because when you go into the documents, the EUA
documents and you do the science, you do the
interrogation of the data to see if it's really different,

229
00:30:03,276 --> 00:30:07,942
you discover it's not.
The data is very clear.
The science is very clear.

230
00:30:08,076 --> 00:30:13,450
The vaccines have not done anything to reduce COVID cases
or deaths.

231
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,706
Just a fundamental question.

232
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:36,470
If you understand that the spike protein is a gain of
function bioweapon, why would you then replicate that
same genetic sequence and put it in a vaccine?

233
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:42,054
I think most people are under the impression that you get an injection
in your muscle, that it stays in your muscle.

234
00:30:42,102 --> 00:30:46,480
Right? Except that's not what happens.
The studies are very clear.

235
00:30:46,990 --> 00:31:02,634
The lip nanoparticle influenza vaccine made by moderna
spread to the brain,
the bone marrow, the liver, the spleen, the heart, kidneys,
the intestine, every part of the animal's body. It doesn't stay
at the site of injection.

236
00:31:02,802 --> 00:31:11,570
These things aren't being directly injected into your
cells. They're being injected into muscle which has fluid
around the cells that drains out to the rest of your body

237
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,702
and gets into your bloodstream where it can have some very
serious consequences.

238
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:26,106
Some of the research that we've recently done has looked at
the Pfizer Moderna and Jansen vaccines and what happens
when they are introduced into human blood.

239
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:34,898
Now, is the introduction of the spike protein into the body
through these so called vaccines functionally different
than the introduction of those spike proteins through the SARS-CoV2 virus?

240
00:31:34,924 --> 00:31:46,070
When people spread infections back and
forth, they spread hundreds of thousands or if you want to
be generous, 10,000 virus particles by coughing or sneezing
on somebody.

241
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:59,678
And so that's the amount that you would get exposed to.
And that's why back in 2020 we saw so many people with the
comorbidities because they already had diseases where there
was inflammation and blood clotting going on

242
00:31:59,704 --> 00:32:04,614
With the vaccines, those numbers are significantly different.
We're not talking about thousands or tens of thousands.

243
00:32:04,662 --> 00:32:08,270
We're talking about billions in these vaccines.

244
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,470
Billions of spiked proteins? Billions of genetic sequences
to make spike proteins.

245
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:21,162
For Pfizer Moderna  it's 131 Billion. For Jansen and AstraZeneca it's 50 billion.

246
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:31,050
And the other thing is that a virus to get into your cell
has to find that S2  receptor that we talked about.
These vaccines don't.

247
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:37,514
The lipid nanoparticles simply merge with your cell
membrane. They don't have to look for any S2 receptors to
get in.

248
00:32:37,552 --> 00:32:41,094
They simply merge with it and release all that genetic sequence.

249
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:45,942
What we're seeing with vaccinated individuals
are healthy people reacting.

250
00:32:46,026 --> 00:32:57,038
Why? Because they're not getting exposed to 1000 or 10,000
virus particles from somebody else who coughed or sneezed
on them which shouldn't have coughed or sneezed on them. Right?

251
00:32:57,064 --> 00:32:59,538
They're getting billions.

252
00:32:59,694 --> 00:33:11,982
And if they have a functioning healthy body, their immune
system is looking at that and saying, wow, we have just
been massively infected.
And they mount an immune response.

253
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:19,818
That immune response has inflammation and blood clotting.
You release chemicals to kill the cells that are infected.

254
00:33:19,854 --> 00:33:28,514
That's why you get a runny nose that's that fluid being
released and blood clotting to wall off the invader so that
it can't get out, number one.

255
00:33:28,552 --> 00:33:31,206
And number two, it can't get nutrients, and so it dies.

256
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:40,130
So that inflammation, blood clotting is what your body
should do, except you don't get infected with billions of
these viruses.

257
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:54,590
So healthy people are reacting to something that looks like
a nuclear bomb went off in their body and they're reacting
to it, producing a lot of inflammation, a lot of blood
clotting, and a lot of very adverse events.

258
00:33:54,970 --> 00:34:06,270
And what we're seeing with all the people with adverse
events are all the people that are healthy, younger,
responding to what appears to be an overwhelming infection
in their body with all the spike proteins.

259
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,778
And we're seeing inflammation and blood clotting.

260
00:34:08,934 --> 00:34:22,526
And you've seen it with strokes and seizures and heart
disease and miscarriages and death that we've never seen
before in the history of mankind for vaccines that have
been made.

261
00:34:22,648 --> 00:34:34,970
I remember in the 70s, mainstream media 60 Minutes did a
documentary showing exposing the lies by Big Pharma and the
FDA on the swine flu vaccine.

262
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:47,610
And at 25 deaths, we decided that something needed to be
done. So it really doesn't matter to me whether it's been
15,000 deaths or 150,000 deaths.

263
00:34:47,790 --> 00:35:01,780
If in 1976, 25 deaths was enough to cause people to say,
we need to investigate this, and in 2020, 15,000
deaths isn't enough, we have a problem.

264
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:12,614
Well, have you seen any evidence that Pfizer
Johnson and Johnson Moderna did animal studies before they
went to the FDA for emergency use authorization?

265
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:22,490
I have not. And I have to tell you that all of these call for
animal models to be done before you do it in the human so
that you know what would happen.

266
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:29,426
And I've done animal research for many decades of my life,
and there's a reason for doing it.

267
00:35:29,548 --> 00:35:32,562
It's because you don't experiment on people unless you're Nazis.

268
00:35:32,586 --> 00:35:46,586
And if I understand it correctly, the CDC VAERS
reporting system is showing more deaths and injuries from
COVID-19 vaccines than all other vaccines combined for the
last 30 years.

269
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:55,960
It is. Independent of whether you believe those numbers or
not. You think they're 1% or 10%, whether you should put 10
or two zeros behind the numbers.

270
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:08,918
Here are some interesting things about this reporting
system. As a physician, I've tried to call in to the
VAERS reporting system and I get a recording that gives
me another telephone number to go to.

271
00:36:09,064 --> 00:36:14,200
When I call that number, it gives me a recording and no
place to leave a message.

272
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:20,860
I have colleagues who have tried to enter it in on the
computer system and it keeps bouncing back.

273
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:31,300
Now, if you come into a hospital or doctor's office and you
have an adverse event to measles, mumps and Rubella
vaccines, there's a code to enter into that and it goes
into the computer.

274
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:39,580
If you have an adverse event to diphtheria tetanus vaccine,
there's a code for that. That goes into the computer and
that will be tracked through history.

275
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:45,738
These things are called computerized procedural terminology
CPT codes.

276
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:53,646
There is no CPT code to enter into a computer system for an
adverse event to any of these SARS-CoV2 vaccines.

277
00:36:53,778 --> 00:37:06,940
Even though this is part of a clinical trial and therefore
they have a legal obligation to track adverse events, there
is no universal code for physicians to code in an adverse
event? That's right.

278
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:10,540
Have you ever seen that before? It's the first time.

279
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:23,366
So these are vaccines that, as I understand it, the ones
that are available are still part of a clinical trial that
lasts until 2023, correct? That's what it shows, yes, on
the national clinical trial site.

280
00:37:23,428 --> 00:37:28,698
And when you're doing a clinical trial, one of the most
important things you need to do is accurately track adverse events,I would assume.

281
00:37:28,734 --> 00:37:34,934
We're going to look back on this.
We're going to look not too distance in the future.

282
00:37:34,972 --> 00:37:45,590
We're going to look back on 2020 and 2021, 2021 in particular and say how
many people really had an adverse event to these vaccines.

283
00:37:53,930 --> 00:38:05,422
Now, have you seen any animal studies that have been
produced or released by any of the current vaccine
manufacturers before emergency use authorization?

284
00:38:05,446 --> 00:38:12,054
I haven't seen any animal studies by those corporations before or
after they've come out.

285
00:38:12,092 --> 00:38:28,374
The only animal studies that have been done are by
independent scientists who have been asking the questions
that these companies should have been asking, which is what
are the consequences in animals to these vaccines?

286
00:38:28,412 --> 00:38:45,418
What has that research uncovered? The research done by independent
researchers have shown that there is damage to the brains
and other body organs caused by these viruses and these
vaccines that are called prion diseases.

287
00:38:45,454 --> 00:38:54,754
So you can have mad cow disease in the brain or Alzheimer's
in the brain or amyloid disease in the heart, which is
another type of prion disease.

288
00:38:54,922 --> 00:39:01,894
But the studies done by people doing the research on the
animals have been very clear and very consistent.

289
00:39:02,062 --> 00:39:11,614
Prion diseases, inflammation and blood clotting or thrombotic
diseases, and real concerns about miscarriages and other
health problems and deaths.

290
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:17,334
None of this has been done by Pfizer, Moderna, Jensen or
the other companies.

291
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:24,730
This animal research could have been done before the
Emergency Use Authorization, but we have no record that it
was ever done or reported.

292
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:31,942
This animal research should have been done.
It violates every Treaty and Code that we've ever had as
human beings.

293
00:39:32,026 --> 00:39:37,700
There was one instance in time that animal research was
abandoned by doing it on people first.

294
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:42,022
And we prosecuted those people in 1947 at the Nuremberg Trials.

295
00:39:42,046 --> 00:40:03,270
One of the questions that we had was what happens
if the vaccine gets into your blood? We've looked at
Pfizer, Moderna, and Janssen, all three, and we have looked
at the effect that those vaccines have on the blood, and
it's almost immediate.

296
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:17,542
What we're going to look at are just three examples of
slides that we took from seven different patients and the
three different vaccines where we put samples of blood on a
microscope slide and looked at them under the microscope.

297
00:40:17,686 --> 00:40:23,674
And what you're going to see here in the first image,
you're going to see the Pfizer vaccine that was added to
the blood.

298
00:40:23,842 --> 00:40:29,430
And you're going to see the nice red color of Rythrocytes,
or red blood cells.

299
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:34,038
That's because they're able to carry oxygen from the lungs
to the body.

300
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:41,518
And what you're going to see next to them are a lot of gray
cells. These are still what's called red blood cells,

301
00:40:41,554 --> 00:40:46,714
although they're no longer red because they are no longer
able to carry oxygen.

302
00:40:46,882 --> 00:40:53,974
And since there's plenty of oxygen already in the air, what
we're seeing is an inability for the hemoglobin in those
cells to bind oxygen.

303
00:40:54,022 --> 00:40:55,460
And they stay this way.

304
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:01,760
After many minutes of watching them, they didn't turn back
or even begin to turn back.

305
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:08,026
And then the second slide you're going to look at, we're
going to see the exact same thing in another patient.

306
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:11,154
This is Medorna once it's been added and you see the same phenomenon.

307
00:41:11,192 --> 00:41:28,410
And then finally, the third cell is the Janssen
vaccine, showing the exact same phenomenon with a loss of
the ability of the hemoglobin to hold oxygen as shown by
gray cells next to the bright red cells that are still functioning,
that haven't been damaged by the vaccine.

308
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:39,630
If we look at these slides, what we're seeing is that when
you added the vaccine to the red blood cells, the red
coloration goes away.

309
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,090
The red coloration goes away, and it stays away.

310
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:48,714
And it's not a matter of adding just a liquid to it because
we also looked at blood when we added normal Saline to it,

311
00:41:48,872 --> 00:41:52,700
and it dilutes it out a little bit, but it doesn't take the
red color away.

312
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:59,274
All three of these vaccines, when we added them to the
blood, the red color to the blood cells goes away,

313
00:41:59,312 --> 00:42:03,510
which means the hemoglobin is no longer able to carry oxygen.

314
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,862
So that could be due to a couple of things.

315
00:42:05,996 --> 00:42:07,522
There's no oxygen to carry.

316
00:42:07,606 --> 00:42:19,782
Well, it's open to the atmosphere, so there's plenty of
oxygen. So it means the hemoglobin molecule has been
damaged or the membrane of the red blood cell has been damaged.

317
00:42:19,796 --> 00:42:27,294
But sickle cell anemia is a damaged, altered blood
cell and it has no difficulty being a red blood cell.

318
00:42:27,452 --> 00:42:32,578
So something's happened to the hemoglobin molecule and it
doesn't reverse.

319
00:42:32,674 --> 00:42:35,902
We've watched the blood for many minutes.
It doesn't reverse.

320
00:42:35,926 --> 00:42:48,702
The other thing we saw is that the blood begins to clump
together and it's not a matter of time because we watched
regular blood of the same individuals with normal saline
added to it and their blood didn't clump.

321
00:42:48,836 --> 00:42:50,686
So it's not a time phenomenon.

322
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:57,250
It's not because they were drawn up in tubes that had
solutions in them that affected the red blood cells,

323
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:05,178
because this blood was drawn directly from the patients,
wasn't put in any tubes with any other material in it that
could interfere with it.

324
00:43:05,264 --> 00:43:09,450
So this is a phenomenon of the vaccines get added.

325
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:16,278
Where the vaccines touch the red blood cells, the red blood
cells turn pale.
They're no longer red.

326
00:43:16,424 --> 00:43:31,582
The important thing is not only the oxygen carrying
capacity, but the fact that that same hemoglobin that picks
up oxygen from your lungs and takes it to your body when
it's in your body, takes the carbon dioxide, the waste
product, out the acid, and takes it back to your lungs.

327
00:43:31,726 --> 00:43:40,194
Well, if the hemoglobin has been damaged so it can't carry
oxygen, that same damage exists and it's unlikely that it's
going to even be able to carry the carbon dioxide out,

328
00:43:40,292 --> 00:43:44,250
although carrying the oxygen is kind of a big deal for red
blood cells.

329
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:51,920
And what would be the consequences of having this depletion
of the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood cells?

330
00:43:52,490 --> 00:44:00,090
Well, none of those red blood cells can carry any oxygen to your
body. The real question is how much of that is going on in
any individual.

331
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:05,962
And no amount of this vaccine, of any of these vaccines
should have damaging effect on red blood cells.

332
00:44:05,986 --> 00:44:11,074
Again, this is a tissue level thing.
This is early on stuff.
This is like the animal studies.

333
00:44:11,122 --> 00:44:23,480
If you're going to be looking at doing something, giving a
drug to a patient, you need to know that the drug will work
and you need to know what consequences there may be.

334
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:27,534
Seriously, this is an easy project to do.

335
00:44:27,572 --> 00:44:38,094
You take the vaccines, you take human blood, you add it to
it, and if anybody can prove to me that what we saw
repeatedly is wrong, hey, go for it, prove me wrong.

336
00:44:38,252 --> 00:44:52,518
But you're not going to because the beautiful thing about
science is that we've conducted this in more than one site
on the planet, and seven different people with all three
vaccines, they all had the same devastating effect to the blood.

337
00:44:52,544 --> 00:45:04,580
Do you have a working theory or hypothesis as to why
these vaccines are causing this blood cell discoloration
and clumping? Yeah, I actually do.

338
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:11,910
We've known for a long period of time that RNA or DNA, when
it's outside of a cell, is a prion.

339
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:19,366
Human red blood cells are the only cells in the human body
that don't have a nucleus and they don't have ribosomes.

340
00:45:19,438 --> 00:45:29,118
All they have is hemoglobin to carry oxygen and carbon
dioxide. So red blood cells can't do anything with genetic
code that's entered into it.

341
00:45:29,264 --> 00:45:34,066
Now, the lipid nanoparticles would simply merge with the
red blood cells.

342
00:45:34,258 --> 00:45:49,366
If the red blood cells behave like any other part of the
body does, that's outside of a cell that doesn't have a
nucleus or ribosomes, when RNA or DNA comes into contact
with it, it acts like a prion and changes the protein structure.

343
00:45:49,438 --> 00:45:52,462
Hemoglobin is a protein.

344
00:45:52,546 --> 00:46:04,978
So what it looks to us like is happening is these vaccines
are releasing the RNA or the DNA from the vaccine into the
red blood cells, having a prime effect on the hemoglobin molecule,

345
00:46:05,014 --> 00:46:15,930
permanently changing the hemoglobin molecule so
that it no longer has the same shape or configuration, so I
can't find oxygen, and it won't be able to pick up carbon
dioxide.

346
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:19,762
Dr. Fleming, are the vaccines reprogramming the innate immune system?

347
00:46:19,786 --> 00:46:30,810
What we have seen is that two of the critical steps
for your immune system the production of something called interferon,

348
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:42,898
which means it interferes with the replication
of the virus, and T helper 2 cells, which are critical
for helping to make antibodies, those are all suppressed.

349
00:46:42,994 --> 00:46:47,406
Now, T helper 2 cells, I know, is a term people haven't
heard. It's a type of T cell.

350
00:46:47,528 --> 00:46:50,566
It helps, and it's number two in the sequence.

351
00:46:50,758 --> 00:46:58,522
It has three components that actually need to match up with
the B cells that make antibodies.

352
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:17,046
Only when all three of those match up does a signal get
sent to your antibody system, what's called the adaptive
humoral antibody system, to make antibodies of a specific
type targeting a specific infection, and to keep memory
cells for that.

353
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:25,954
Now, in the absence of those T help 2 cells being
produced like they should, that system, even though it
exists, is going to be blunted.

354
00:47:26,122 --> 00:47:33,186
Based on all of this, would somebody be totally off base if
they believe these vaccines were, in and of themselves, a bioweapon?

355
00:47:33,188 --> 00:47:39,642
Well, the fact that the spike protein is a gain
of function developed virus, which, by definition, is a bioweapon,

356
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:48,330
replicating that same genetic sequence and
putting it into a vaccine, it doesn't matter how you get it
into the human body.

357
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,610
It's still a bioweapon.

358
00:47:51,410 --> 00:48:03,980
Most alarmingly for the children right now, when you have
people at an FDA meeting making a statement that we need to
vaccinate the children, but we won't know what happens to
them until we vaccinate them.

359
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:08,322
That's the experimental phase of a research project.

360
00:48:08,516 --> 00:48:20,010
And as of 1947, I thought that we had officially, although
it's very clear from the Tuskegee Airmen and other studies
that have been done, paid for by the US. Government,

361
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:32,998
that it seems that our leaders don't have a
problem experimenting on our elderly, on our police
officers, on our first responders, on our doctors and nurses,

362
00:48:33,024 --> 00:48:38,400
on our general public, and now apparently don't
have a problem experimenting on our children.

363
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:51,542
So if you were advising, for example, the Texas Health
Commissioner on how to fight this attack, what would you recommend?

364
00:48:51,556 --> 00:48:55,206
Well, it goes back to one of the statements I
made earlier.

365
00:48:55,278 --> 00:49:01,994
When you're doing something in medicine or science of any
sort and there's a bad outcome, you quit doing it.

366
00:49:02,152 --> 00:49:07,586
One of my medical students came up to me, said, Dr.
Fleminng, it didn't work the last few times.

367
00:49:07,648 --> 00:49:16,070
We gave this medication to somebody, and they had a really
bad outcome, but I want to try it again, because maybe
it'll work this time.
I'd probably kick them off the rotation.

368
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:26,598
We don't keep repeating the things that caused the problem.
All the evidence shows there's no statistical benefit to
using these vaccines.

369
00:49:26,754 --> 00:49:39,100
The mass vaccination has caused pressure selection of these
variants. It has produced significant adverse effects in
the people it's been given to.

370
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:49,120
The FDA has admitted during its EUA documents for children
that we won't know what it does to our children until we
experiment on our children.

371
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:57,290
It's very clear these vaccines have done nothing to solve
the problem.
They need to be stopped.

372
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:00,830
The companies need to be held legally accountable.

373
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:10,202
The questions about why all these Codes and Treaties that
we claim that we honor are being abused needs to be addressed.

374
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:23,346
The gain of functional research needs to be
stopped, at least until it can be done at some point under
some type of control, where it actually provides a benefit
for humanity without a harm.

375
00:50:23,418 --> 00:50:27,302
We need to hold people accountable that have been
responsible for doing this.

376
00:50:27,436 --> 00:50:33,626
They have violated the Biological Weapons Convention
treaty. They have violated the Nuremberg Code.

377
00:50:33,748 --> 00:50:37,482
They have violated the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights.

378
00:50:37,626 --> 00:50:47,210
They have violated the American Medical Association Code of
Ethics, which may not be a criminal act, but it's the way I
thought we were kind of practicing medicine or we're
supposed to practice medicine.

379
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:53,846
There comes a time for everybody to be held accountable for
things that they do.

380
00:50:53,908 --> 00:50:57,220
People make mistakes.
I'm human.

381
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:07,818
You won't have any challenges finding somebody that would
tell you that I make mistakes, okay? I know I make
mistakes. I'm my worst critic on a science and medical perspective.

382
00:51:07,914 --> 00:51:20,200
Two decades worth of gain of function research
all focused on increasing the infectivity of this virus
with consequences that are very clear around the world.

383
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:27,100
We took procedures in 2020 and 2021 that make no
scientific sense.

384
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:34,842
There's no data to show that the quarantining of citizens
around the world stop this virus.

385
00:51:34,986 --> 00:51:40,814
If there is, explain to me why in 2021 this virus is
endemic. It didn't stop it.

386
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:45,110
Physicians abandoned the practice of medicine for a variety
of reasons.

387
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:50,642
Some of them might have literally thought they were doing
the right thing.

388
00:51:50,836 --> 00:51:59,020
Many of them did it because they were told there were no
treatments. And who told them that? Agencies out of the
federal government.

389
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:07,610
The federal government run by Fauci and Collins and other
people. Those agencies don't practice medicine.

390
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:18,278
You don't call them when you go to the hospital.
Your physician practices medicine.
That's the person you see that takes care of you.

391
00:52:18,364 --> 00:52:23,634
We have interfered with the practice of medicine.

392
00:52:23,802 --> 00:52:34,230
We have interfered with physicians feeling like they could
practice medicine. For the physicians who haven't bothered
to actually measure treatment outcomes but are espousing a
number of drugs.

393
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:40,562
I encourage them to actually get the quantified meausre data
to see whether they work or they don't work.

394
00:52:40,696 --> 00:52:46,118
But at least they're trying something which is kind of what
we used to always do before we figured it out.

395
00:52:46,144 --> 00:52:55,086
I was there when HIV hit the scenes.
We didn't know what we were doing, so we worked.
We winged it.
We treated symptoms.

396
00:52:55,158 --> 00:52:57,366
They were short of breath.
We gave them breathing treatments.

397
00:52:57,438 --> 00:53:04,734
2019, we quit giving breathing treatments to people short
of breath even if they were wheezing because, well, there
was no treatment, right?

398
00:53:04,782 --> 00:53:09,830
All the things that we did in science and medicine
was throwing out the windows.

399
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:13,802
We locked on a society.
We put fear in everybody's heart.

400
00:53:13,936 --> 00:53:21,786
We told people to quit believing people who might tell you
something different.
We quit challenging the scientific paradigm.

401
00:53:21,858 --> 00:53:30,614
In science, we're always debating anybody who thinks that physicians
and scientists are just this jolly group of people that are
constantly agreeing with each other.

402
00:53:30,652 --> 00:53:39,194
No scientific debate is constantly had.
Physicians frequently will talk amongst ourselves and debate
what should or shouldn't be done.

403
00:53:39,232 --> 00:53:42,100
But that's a free exchange of ideas that hasn't been done.

404
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:58,154
Texas Medical Association health authorities, the governor,
the attorney general all of the people should be looking at
why this happened to make sure that Texans are taken care
of and other people in the country have an opportunity to follow.

405
00:53:58,192 --> 00:54:07,720
It needs to be holding accountable to people that
caused this chaos, this mayhem to begin with and stopping
it from occurring again.

406
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:15,970
Follow truth and plain sight, bringing truth to light in
unbiased, nonpartisan factually, founded reporting
worldwide.
